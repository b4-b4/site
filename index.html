		<p>Hi, my username is b4b4, I'm 15 years old and I do Python, PHP, HTML and CSS. I have a few projects in computer science for which I invest most of my time.</p>
		<p>I'm a big fan of open source, computer science, virtual reality and physics. I use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">VIM</a> code editor which, to my taste, is a real advantage in terms of productivity. Not liking that my data is at the mercy of anyone, I prefer using <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat">IRC</a> to Discord. This one has the advantage to keep out all the people who don't have a correct level in computer science. Finally, I use the fabulous <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arch_Linux">Arch Linux</a> distribution. Why do I use it? It is delivered as empty as possible and its <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacman_(Arch_Linux)">pacman</a> package manager makes me wonder.</p>
		<p>Among the many projects I'm working on are a search assistant, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(operating_system)">kernel</a> on which you can build your operating system like with LEGOs, a compact programming language that would drastically minimize the number of lines of code in a project, and that, in support of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source">open-source</a> movement, would require anyone who wants to commercialize their project to make it open-source.</p>
		<p>You can find my open-source projects on my <a href="https://github.com/b4-b4">GitHub</a> and to go further, if you wish, visit <a href="#">my blog</a> on technologies in general.</p>
